# Enhanced Terminal Environment

A comprehensive 12-month structured learning path for mastering terminal-based software development, designed for full-stack engineers working with Python, JavaScript, and Ruby.

## Overview

This project provides a progressive approach to learning essential terminal tools for a modern software development workflow:

- **Shell** (Bash/Zsh) for command-line navigation and automation
- **Neovim** for efficient text editing and programming
- **Tmux** for terminal multiplexing and session management
- **Git/GitHub CLI** for version control and collaboration
- **Docker** for containerization and deployment
- **SQL/NoSQL Databases** for data storage and retrieval
- **Cloud CLI Tools** for infrastructure management
- **HTTP Client Tools** for API testing and integration
- **Package Managers** for dependency management
- **Monitoring Tools** for system and application performance

The course focuses on core fundamentals first, gradually introducing more advanced concepts as your skills develop.

## Philosophy

This learning path is built on these core principles:

- **Mastery Through Deliberate Practice**: Regular, focused practice of specific skills
- **Progressive Skill Acquisition**: Learn fundamentals before moving to advanced concepts
- **Minimal Yet Powerful**: Focus on essential tools that provide the most value
- **Cross-Platform**: Works consistently on both macOS and Linux
- **Project-Based Learning**: Apply skills to real-world projects
- **Language Polyglot**: Support for Python, JavaScript, and Ruby workflows

## Getting Started

### Installation
